<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
<h3 align="center"> About The Project</h3>

<p align="center">
  This project presents a Quantum Circuit Simulator developed using Python and Qiskit. The simulator enables users to create and manipulate quantum circuits, apply quantum gates, and visualize the results through a graphical interface. It also includes a noise simulation feature to demonstrate the impact of imperfections on quantum operations. The tool provides an interactive platform for exploring quantum computing concepts and is designed to help users better understand quantum circuits and their behaviors.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
<h4 align="center"> Getting Started with VSCode </h4>

Follow the instructions on setting up your project locally in VSCode.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have Python and Anaconda installed. If not, follow the instructions below:

1. **Install Anaconda and Python:**
   - **Anaconda**: Anaconda is a distribution that helps manage Python environments and dependencies easily. Download and install Anaconda from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).
   - **Python**: If you don't have Python installed separately, you can use Anaconda to manage Python versions as well.

2. **Create a Python Environment Using Anaconda**:
   - First, create a new environment using Anaconda. This environment will have Python 3.11 and will allow you to install all the required dependencies for this project:
     ```sh
     conda create -n quantum_env python=3.11
     ```
   - Then, activate the environment:
     ```sh
     conda activate quantum_env
     ```

3. **Install Required Python Packages**:
   You will need the following Python packages for the project. You can install them using `pip`:
      ```sh
   pip install cirq
   pip install qiskit
   pip install matplotlib
   pip install numpy
   pip install scipy
   pip install pandas
   pip install pennylane
   pip install qutip
   pip install qiskit_aer

**Using Anacoda install jupyter**: 
 ```sh
conda install jupyter
 ```

### Installation

5. **Download the `EDITED_EMTECH` Folder:**
   - You can download the `EDITED_EMTECH` folder directly from [this link](https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name/tree/main/EDITED_EMTECH) or just by checking the files above.

6. **Either download it as a whole and extract the folder, or create a folder and manually download the files, then insert them into the folder.**
   - There should be 4 files in the folder.
   ```sh
   main.py
   mqb_h.py
   sqb_h.py
   interference.py
   ```
7. **Now, just run the main.py file**
